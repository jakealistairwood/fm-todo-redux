# FRONTENDMENTOR - TODO CHALLENGE 

![FM-TODO-Preview](https://github.com/jakealistairwood/fm-todo-redux/blob/master/src/assets/design/desktop-preview.jpg)

This was a frontendmentor.io challenge in which I had to recreate a Todo app. This was my first introduction into using React Redux to manage the state in the application. 

Via the useDispatch and useSelector hooks I was able to:

- Enable the storing of a todo to the overall state
- Toggle whether a todo had been completed or not
- Allow the deletion of a todo from the stored list
- Delete all completed todos

The app also allows the user to display either all the todos or those that are still active / completed. 

## Tech

* Functional React
* Redux
* Styled Components
* SCSS

## Todos

Implement a drag & drop feature to enable the user to sort their todos in an order they find meaningful.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
